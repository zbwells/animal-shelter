        <p> WCAS serves Wise County, Virginia. We are a small shelter 
            located in Norton, Virginia. We accept donations of food, 
            cleaning products, and more.<br>
        <br>
        If you want to know which items/resources we currently need, please 
        <a class="contactlink" href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/contact">contact us.</a>
        <br> <br>We adopt dogs out directly, but also work with local rescues to
        foster the animals that come through our doors. For information about 
        fostering or adopting, 
        <a class="contactlink" href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/contact">give us a call.</a><br>
        <br> Our kennels are usually full, so
        we encourage all potential adoptees to  
        <a class="contactlink" href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/contact">
        stop by and see the pets. <BR><br></a>
